By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime&apos;s java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.</system-out><system-err>location: /home/jenkins/.mvnrepository/io/quarkus/arc/arc/1.2.0.Final/arc-1.2.0.Final.jar</system-err></testcase><testcase classname="CVE-2020-10693" name="pkg:maven/io.quarkus.arc/arc@1.2.0.Final"><skipped message="These vulnerabilities are K8S server side vulnerabilities related to specific versions of K8S.

For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime&apos;s java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.</system-out><system-err>location: /home/jenkins/.mvnrepository/io/quarkus/quarkus-arc/1.2.0.Final/quarkus-arc-1.2.0.Final.jar</system-err></testcase><testcase classname="CVE-2020-10693" name="pkg:maven/io.quarkus/quarkus-arc@1.2.0.Final"><skipped message="These vulnerabilities are K8S server side vulnerabilities related to specific versions of K8S.
